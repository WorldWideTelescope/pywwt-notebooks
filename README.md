# Example notebooks for pywwt

This repository contains example notebooks for the
[pywwt](https://pywwt.readthedocs.org) package, which provides access to the
[AAS] [WorldWide Telescope] inside Python and Jupyter environments.

*Note: it is usually fast to launch a notebook server, but if updates were
recently merged into this repository, you may have to wait a few minutes for
the backing software images to be rebuilt.*

Once youâ€™ve launched a cloud server, you can upload and run your own notebooks
[as shown in this YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=gi2oC4AYrWU).
(Note that while the video shows an older organization of this notebook
collection, the general technique still applies.)


## Testing the BinderHub infrastructure locally

If youâ€™d like to make changes to this repository and want to test how theyâ€™ll
work on [BinderHub], you can do so by installing and using [jupyter-repo2docker]
â€” assuming your machine also has [Docker] installed. Just run:

```
$ jupyter-repo2docker /path/to/pywwt-notebooks
```

to build an image of this repository and launch it as a server. To test the
[JupyterLab] environment as opposed to classic Jupyter, open up the URL
suggested by the `jupyter-repo2docker` command and change its path to `/lab`
instead of `/tree`.
